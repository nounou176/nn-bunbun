Last updated: 2026-08-12

## Current milestone

Milestone 6 — Evidence and SQLite persistence: Next, not started.

Active ExecPlan: none.

Completed ExecPlans:

- plans/2026-08-10-project-foundation.md
- plans/2026-08-10-contracts-and-catalog-fixtures.md
- plans/2026-08-11-isometric-runtime-foundation.md
- plans/2026-08-11-first-deterministic-learning-loop.md
- plans/2026-08-12-complete-mvp-primitive-runtime.md

## Completed work

- Established the durable product vision, architecture, gameplay primitives,
  LessonManifest 0.1.0 specification, performance direction, decisions,
  roadmap, current-state record, and ExecPlan standard.
- Recorded manual browser/gameplay testing, repository continuity, and the
  local-first release gate as accepted operating decisions.
- Created the Node.js 24.18.0/npm 11.16.0 workspace with separate Vite web,
  node:http server, and shared-contract packages.
- Created the responsive Milestone 1 foundation page and deterministic health
  and JSON 404 endpoints.
- Received the user's manual acceptance of Milestone 1 and recorded the
  supplied desktop screenshot.
- Accepted D-017: TypeBox 1.x is the schema-first source, Ajv performs strict
  structural validation, and pure TypeScript performs semantic validation.
- Implemented the complete LessonManifest 0.1.0 schema, including all three
  learning-target variants, eight interaction variants, ten scaffold variants,
  completion, quality, provenance, and closed nested records.
- Implemented CatalogSnapshot 0.1.0 for scenes, spawn points, cameras, asset
  bundles, locations, entities, objects and affordances, cues, voices, and
  reference records.
- Implemented stable, sorted structural and semantic diagnostics without
  mutation, coercion, defaults, repair, or removal of unknown properties.
- Implemented deterministic catalog, reference, scene, spawn, state,
  affordance, audio, cue, provenance, interaction, scaffold, graph,
  reachability, completion, coverage, evidence, support-locale, text-safety,
  and quality checks.
- Added one valid FIND_SOMETHING lesson and catalog fixture plus the six
  roadmap-required invalid fixtures.
- Added generated LessonManifest and CatalogSnapshot JSON Schema artifacts and
  a drift check covering all eight generated artifacts.
- Added a manifest inspection command and 14 focused contract tests.
- Proved the server and web consume the same LessonManifest version through an
  isolated browser-safe export; the Milestone 2 web production JavaScript was
  1.76 kB rather than bundling validators.
- Received the user's manual acceptance of Milestone 2 on 2026-08-11; the valid
  inspector, visible LessonManifest 0.1.0 value, and health contractVersion
  0.1.0 all passed.
- Accepted D-018: Three.js 0.185.1, desktop Chromium as the reference
  environment, automatic WebGPU with a forced WebGL2 fallback path, a fixed
  orthographic isometric camera, direct convex-region movement, and explicit
  provisional performance goals.
- Implemented the asynchronous renderer lifecycle, automatic fallback,
  recoverable error UI, capped-DPR resize, visibility pause/resume, frame-delta
  cap, context-loss boundary, page/HMR teardown, and owned GPU disposal.
- Added the repository-owned park_small glTF technical fixture, code-owned
  asset registry and scene definition, required-node validation, stable
  catalog-aligned guide/dog/cat identities, authored navigation bounds, and
  placeholder Bunbun player.
- Implemented registered-object and walkable-ground raycasting, deterministic
  click-to-move with replacement destinations, dog/cat selection and highlight,
  bounded zoom, and DOM/canvas input isolation.
- Added runtime diagnostics for renderer, FPS, average/p95 frame time, draw
  calls, triangles, render size/DPR, scene-ready time, pick response, selection,
  and movement plus eight focused web runtime tests.
- Added explicit `renderer=webgl2`, `debug=1`, and one-shot
  `assetFailure=1` local query controls without adding an environment variable.
- Received the user's `PASS` for the Milestone 3 manual functional matrix on
  2026-08-11, covering normal rendering, movement and selection, forced WebGL2,
  asset-failure retry, resize, background/resume, and reload behavior. Numeric
  diagnostics and reference-device details were not included in the report.
- Received a second explicit `PASS` on 2026-08-11 for the requested diagnostics
  and performance acceptance. Milestone 3 is closed on the user's qualitative
  acceptance; exact runtime values remain unreported and are not reconstructed.
- Accepted D-019 and implemented a second reviewed FIND_SOMETHING fixture with
  the required LISTEN → CLICK_OBJECT → CHOOSE sequence while preserving the
  Milestone 2 one-step fixture.
- Added full structural and semantic lesson-package validation before renderer
  startup plus a closed Milestone 4 capability gate for the scene, object,
  audio, cue, scaffold, and primitive executors that actually exist.
- Added a pure deterministic lesson controller with bounded attempts, authored
  scaffold escalation, seeded choices, assisted outcomes, feedback input
  locking, required-step completion, and a fresh in-memory session on restart.
- Added visibility-aware active timing and idempotent session-local exposure,
  heard, reaction, step-completed, and lesson-completed records. Heard evidence
  is written only after playback starts and replay cannot duplicate it.
- Added the temporary learner-gesture SpeechSynthesis adapter behind
  AudioPlaybackPort, a visible assisted audio-failure path, Japanese-first DOM
  learning UI, deterministic focus transitions, and candidate-filtered world
  input/highlight/cue commands.
- Added `manifestFailure=1` and `audioFailure=1` local controls and expanded
  diagnostics with lesson progress, heard/terminal/assisted outcomes,
  correct/wrong reaction counts, active time, latest reaction latency, and time
  to first lesson stimulus.
- The user's first Milestone 4 browser attempt exposed a world-to-lesson bridge
  defect: picking selected `dog`, but `find_dog` remained `AWAITING_OBJECT`
  with zero reactions. Replaced the indirect post-construction callback with an
  atomic candidate-and-handler input gate and added a focused regression test.
- The same screenshot exposed a diagnostics error: `render.calls` reported
  cumulative render invocations as draw calls. Diagnostics now use the
  per-frame `render.drawCalls` value.
- The user confirmed the corrected animal click reaches the lesson, then found
  an EXPLORE affordance issue: the centered translucent lesson card made the
  world appear modal and disabled. EXPLORE now uses a compact left-side mission
  card, reduced edge dimming, an active canvas cursor, and an explicit
  Japanese/Vietnamese instruction to click an animal in the park.
- Passed schema drift, typecheck, lint, format, 38 focused tests, and the
  production build after the fixes. The Milestone 4 JavaScript is 1,229,245
  bytes minified (340.84 kB gzip); the known Vite large-chunk warning remains
  visible.
- Received the user's explicit `PASS` on 2026-08-12 for the corrected compact
  EXPLORE presentation and the complete Milestone 4 manual happy-path,
  edge-case, failure-control, renderer, resize, and regression checklist.
  Milestone 4 is closed.
- Accepted D-020 after the user's Milestone 5 plan approval and kept
  LessonManifest/CatalogSnapshot at 0.1.0 while completing the remaining fixed
  primitive executors.
- Promoted exact TYPE normalization and Unicode code-point helpers into one
  browser-safe contracts utility shared by semantic validation and gameplay.
- Added a valid eight-step HELP_SOMEONE fixture that executes LISTEN, ARRANGE,
  CLICK_OBJECT, TYPE, MOVE_TO, PICK_UP, GIVE, and CHOOSE in one acyclic required
  path while preserving both earlier valid fixtures.
- Expanded the technical catalog and code-owned park registry with animal and
  bench locations plus a second visitor NPC. The new content remains a
  technical fixture and does not resolve O-001 or O-002.
- Extended the pure lesson controller with stable duplicate ARRANGE token IDs,
  seeded ordering, exact normalized TYPE answers, Unicode input limits,
  preserveSubmittedState, authored location arrival, deterministic movement
  failure recovery, one task-scoped carry slot, assisted PICK_UP, wrong-recipient
  retention, correct GIVE transfer, and invalid-carry rejection.
- Added accessible DOM token and Japanese TYPE controls with pointer, keyboard,
  deterministic focus, and IME composition isolation. Added dynamic compact
  EXPLORE action cues for objects, locations, pickup, movement, and recipients.
- Generalized the atomic lesson input gate into isolated OBJECT, LOCATION, and
  RECIPIENT modes. Added authored location markers, arrival-radius movement,
  guide/visitor selection, dog follow/escort presentation, transfer placement,
  and clean world restart without inventory, physics, collision, or pathfinding.
- Added `movementFailure=1` and `carryFailure=1` one-shot local controls and
  diagnostics for world target mode, pending location, and carried object.
- Passed schema drift, typecheck, lint, formatting, 46 focused tests, manifest
  inspection, the production build, and local web/health/404 HTTP smoke checks.
- Received the user's explicit `PASS` on 2026-08-12 for the complete Milestone 5
  manual happy-path, edge-case, failure-control, renderer, lifecycle, and
  performance matrix. No numeric diagnostics or per-scenario notes were
  supplied, so the milestone is closed on qualitative acceptance without a
  wider browser/device or numeric runtime claim.

## Current work

- Milestone 5 is complete and has no reported blocking browser defect.
- Milestone 6 is next but has not started. Discuss O-003 mastery aggregation,
  O-007 SQLite tooling/progress ownership, and O-011 privacy/retention before
  approving an ExecPlan or implementing persistence.

The canonical repository is /home/nunu/Desktop/nnlab/nn-bunbun. It is on main
with origin set to https://github.com/nounou176/nn-bunbun.git. Milestones 0–2
are published at 27355c0 on origin/main. Milestone 3 is committed locally at
6a44abd. The Milestone 4 runtime/input correction, EXPLORE UX, and closure are
committed locally at 963fae3, 2aa07f6, and 8184ce3. Milestone 5 implementation
and closure changes are not yet committed.

## Known issues

1. The fixture catalog proves identities and capabilities but does not provide
   production scene, mesh, navigation, image, or audio assets.
2. Contract 0.1.0 rejects every graph cycle because it has no counter or
   condition language with which to prove an arbitrary cycle bounded.
3. Deterministic validators cannot judge natural Japanese quality or future
   physical reachability from 3D geometry; those require later review/runtime
   systems.
4. Forced WebGL2, the functional matrix, and the provisional performance matrix
   passed by user report, but numeric runtime measurements and named-device
   details were not supplied. No wider browser, mobile, or touch support is
   claimed.
5. Initial learner level, support locale, scene, scenario, and target set are
   not selected.
6. Mastery aggregation, weak-target scheduling, analytics privacy, progress
   synchronization, and compiler-draft normalization remain deferred.
7. The login shell resolves system Node.js 18.19.1 until NVM is sourced;
   contributors must run nvm use to activate Node.js 24.18.0.
8. Deployment topology remains intentionally deferred until local
   release-candidate acceptance.
9. The Milestone 5 WebGPU-capable web build is 1,254,603 bytes minified and
   triggers Vite's default uncompressed chunk warning, although its measured
   gzip size is 346.59 kB. Browser validation is qualitatively accepted, but
   reported numeric measurements must still guide any splitting.
10. Browser SpeechSynthesis voice quality and availability vary by installed
    desktop voice. It is a temporary technical adapter, not production TTS or
    an offline-audio guarantee.
11. Milestone 5 evidence is intentionally session-local. Reload and restart use
    a fresh session until Milestone 6 defines persistence and safe resume.
12. RECOGNITION_FALLBACK is valid in contract 0.1.0 but has no accepted web
    runtime rejoin semantics. D-020 keeps it capability-rejected in
    Milestone 5 rather than guessing behavior.
13. PICK_UP uses a technical dog follow/escort presentation and one carry slot;
    it is not production animal handling, an inventory, or a physics system.
14. Milestone 5 browser behavior is manually accepted, but the user supplied no
    numeric diagnostics, named-device details, or per-scenario evidence. The
    result does not establish broader browser, mobile, or touch support.

## Next recommended work

Prepare a Milestone 6 overview and discuss O-003, O-007, and O-011 before
creating or approving its persistence ExecPlan. Do not infer storage ownership,
mastery policy, or privacy defaults merely because SQLite is the planned local
technology.

## Verification status

- Dependency installation: an isolated clean `npm ci --ignore-scripts
  --offline` passed with Node.js 24.18.0/npm 11.16.0; 146 packages were added,
  150 packages were audited, and zero vulnerabilities were reported. The final
  lockfile also passes an in-place offline dry-run.
- Generated artifact drift check: passed for two schemas and six invalid
  fixtures.
- Typecheck: passed for contracts, server, web source, and web test tooling.
- Lint and format check: passed.
- Tests: passed, 46 of 46: 18 contract tests and 28 web lesson/runtime tests.
- Fixture inspection: the valid lesson passed; all six invalid fixtures exited
  nonzero with their intended stable error codes.
- Production build: passed for contracts, server, and web workspaces; web
  output contains 1,254,603-byte JavaScript (346.59 kB gzip reported by Vite),
  10,696-byte CSS (2.90 kB gzip), a 5,899-byte local glTF fixture, and 520-byte
  HTML. Vite reports the known JavaScript chunk warning.
- HTTP regression: passed after starting temporary local Node 24 processes for
  updated web HTML, health contractVersion 0.1.0, and JSON 404. Sandbox port
  binding required approved local access; both processes were stopped cleanly.
- Scope regression: passed; the executor is limited to the eight accepted fixed
  primitives, in-memory events, one task-scoped carry slot, and the isolated
  temporary browser speech adapter. No AI, provider key, persistence, analytics
  transport, production TTS, physics runtime, Docker, deployment, or automated
  browser E2E artifact was added. The locked `@types/three` development package
  has an unused transitive Rapier type dependency; Bunbun does not import or
  bundle it.
- Docker build: not applicable; Dockerfiles intentionally do not exist.
- Milestone 1 manual browser test: passed by user report on 2026-08-10.
- Milestone 2 manual acceptance: passed by user report on 2026-08-11; the valid
  inspector, visible LessonManifest 0.1.0 value, and health contractVersion
  0.1.0 were confirmed.
- Milestone 3 manual functional acceptance: passed by user report on
  2026-08-11. A second `PASS` closed the requested performance checklist; exact
  reference-environment and numeric diagnostics remain unreported.
- Milestone 4 manual acceptance: passed by explicit user report on 2026-08-12
  after the world-input and EXPLORE-affordance corrections.
- Milestone 5 manual acceptance: passed by explicit user report on 2026-08-12
  for the complete supplied matrix. Acceptance is qualitative because no
  numeric diagnostics or per-scenario notes were supplied.
- Automated browser E2E tooling: intentionally excluded by D-011.

## Risks

- Later compiler Structured Outputs may need a separate all-required draft
  schema and deterministic normalization into the playable contract; it must
  not weaken LessonManifest 0.1.0.
- Catalog capability checks do not replace Milestone 3 measurements of
  navigation, object overlap, renderer compatibility, or real asset budgets.
- Milestone 4 preserves partial screenshot metrics, but browser version,
  device/GPU identity, display details, warm/cold split, and audio-start latency
  remain unreported despite qualitative acceptance.
- Manual-only browser validation depends on disciplined user reports; the
  Milestone 5 overall PASS provides no retained screenshots, numeric runtime
  measurements, or per-case evidence for later comparison.
- Persistence introduces new correctness and privacy risks. Milestone 6 must
  decide idempotency ownership, safe resume boundaries, retention, and the
  distinction between assisted and unaided evidence before storing learner
  data.
